# Cognifyz Java Internship Projects

This repository contains the Java console applications I built during my internship at Cognifyz Technologies (Marchâ€“April 2025).

## Tasks
- Task 1: Number Guessing Game
- Task 2: Sand Glass Number Pattern
- Task 3: Task Manager (CRUD)
- Task 4: Temperature Converter

Each program demonstrates core Java concepts like loops, conditionals, OOP, and collections.
